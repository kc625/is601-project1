    <h1>Pylint Tips & Tricks! Bonus: Glossary of OOP Terms</h1>

        <h2>What Exactly is Pylint?</h2>
        <p>
            When it comes to programming, linting is the checking of your code for syntactical or stylistic errors. This is typically done through an automated process with something called a lint tool (or linter). Pylint is one such lint tool that works on Python code. Pylint not only checks for errors in your code, but it also tries to enforce a certain coding standard when it comes to the stylistic and visual choices you make when writing a program. Most would argue that this is where linters have their greatest value. Sure, catching the actual errors within your program is important, but those errors would also be revealed when running or testing your programs. Following a linter's stylistic suggestions, however, can help you take the next step in becoming a better programmer. The first time that a new programmer uses Pylint to evaluate their code, they are probably going to receive several errors. And that's okay! Most of those errors will probably be related to the stylistic standard I keep mentioning, and those errors are usually easy to fix.
        </p>
        <h2>Common Pylint Errors (and how to fix them!)</h2>
        <p>
            As mentioned already, those new to using Pylint will probably run into a decent amount of errors early on. The following errors are likely to be encountered. Here are some tips on how to fix them.
        </p>
        <h3>Final Newline Missing</h3>
        <p>
            If you receive the <code>missing-final-newline</code> error, then that means your program has ended on a line that contains code in it. To resolve this error, simply return to a new line at the end and leave that final line blank. The reason this blank newline is needed, is because historically some tools have had problems reading files if the last line has text on it but does not have a newline at the end. While this is not always the case for Python tools nowadays, it is still good practice to end each file with a newline.
        </p>
        <h3>Missing Docstring</h3>
        <p>
            A missing docstring error could actually appear in a couple of forms. You may get this error pertaining to one of your classes with <code>missing-class-docstring</code> or possibly one of your functions with <code>missing-function-docstring</code>. Another missing docstring error you may encounter is the <code>missing-module-docstring</code> if you didn't add a docstring to the beginning of your file. Docstrings are important. They let someone else that has never seen your program before, quickly look at your code and get instant clues to what you are trying to accomplish. If you get a missing docstring error, add one where the error specifies, like the following. The docstrings are highlighted in green:
        </p>
        <p>
            <code style="display:block; white-space:pre-wrap">
        <span style="color: green">"""This is our base Calculation Class"""</span>
        class Calculation:
            <span style="color: green">"""Abstract base class used for all other calculations"""</span>

            def __init__(self, values: tuple):
                <span style="color: green">"""Constructor method"""</span>
                self.values = Calculation.convert_args_to_tuple_of_floats(values)
            </code>
        <h3>Line Too Long</h3>
        <p>
            Pylint gives you a <code>line-too-long</code> error if any line of your code has greater than 100 characters in it. When we are coding, we should aim to accomplish our goal as succinctly as possible. This is true for total lines of code, as well as how long each line is. You are likely to see this error in reference to a line that contains a docstring. In that case, simply shorten the description within your docstring so that it is under the recommended 100-character limit. If it is referencing a line that contains actual code, perhaps consider alternate ways of achieving the same outcome. Preferably with more, but shorter, lines of code.
        </p>
        <h3>Unused Variable</h3>
        <p>
            Within the functions we create, we often have the ability to define and use variables. If we are not careful though, we may accidentally create variables that we do not actually use within the function. Consider the following block of code:
        </p>
        <p>
            <code style="display:block; white-space:pre-wrap">
        @staticmethod
        def convert_args_to_tuple_of_floats(values):
            """Standardizes values to a tuple of floats"""
            list_values_float = []
            <span style="color: red">unnecessary_list = []</span>
            for item in values:
                list_values_float.append(float(item))
            return tuple(list_values_float)
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>
            If we had this function in our program, Pylint would give us an <code>unused-variable</code> error. Notice the list variable we created that is highlighted in red, <code>unnecessary_list</code>. After defining it, we do not use it for the rest of the function. If that variable was removed, this function would produce the same output and have the same functionality to users. To resolve this error, we should remove the unused variable completely.
        </p>
        <h3>Invalid Name</h3>
        <p>
            Pylint prefers we use the naming convention known as snake case when naming our variables, functions, etc. as opposed to other popular conventions like camel case. If you receive an <code>invalid-name</code> error from Pylint, one of your functions or variables is likely named in camel case. What's the difference? This is one of our functions named in camel case: <code>getLastCalculationResult()</code>. This is the same function named in snake case: <code>get_last_calculation_result()</code>. Do you see how, thanks to the underscores present, the latter is a bit clearer and easier to read? This is especially true the longer a variable or function name is. This is why Pylint prefers snake case.
        </p>
        <h3>Unnecessary Else Statement</h3>
        <p>
            Consider the following function that is a part of our Division class:
        </p>
        <p>
            <code style="display:block; white-space:pre-wrap">
        def get_result(self):
            """This does the actual division. Displays an error if dividing by 0"""
            quotient = self.values[0]
            for value in self.values[1:]
                if value == 0.0:
                    return "Error, cannot divide by zero."
                else:
                    quotient = quotient / value
            return quotient
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>
            This function takes a tuple of floats as a parameter and sets a variable equal to the first value of the tuple. It then loops through the rest of the values and checks to see if they are equivalent to 0. If the value is, it returns an error message. If it isn't, the function divides the first value by each consecutive value. However, if we use this function in a program, Pylint gives us a <code>no-else-return</code> error. What does this mean? Pylint is trying to tell us that the <code>else:</code> is actually unnecessary, as it is redundant. Should <code>if value == 0.0:</code> be evaluated as false, our program will move on to <code>quotient = quotient / value</code> regardless of whether the actual <code>else:</code> is present or not. So for the sake of brevity, we can cut that line out of our code, and the following, more streamlined version of the function would work exactly the same:
        </p>
        <p>
            <code style="display:block; white-space:pre-wrap">
        def get_result(self):
            """This does the actual division. Displays an error if dividing by 0"""
            quotient = self.values[0]
            for value in self.values[1:]
                if value == 0.0:
                    return "Error, cannot divide by zero."
                quotient = quotient / value
            return quotient
            </code>
        </p>

        <h2>Along Comes ARPA</h2>
        <p>
            ARPA, the Advanced Research Projects Agency, was created to take over research and development for the United States military.  The acronym title of ARPA was later changed to DARPA, when "Defense" was added to the beginning of the agency's name.  Before ARPA, each branch of the  military did their own separate research and development.  ARPA was created to centralize the research and development for all branches of the military.  With ARPA, the Army, Navy, Air Force, etc. could focus all of their efforts and manpower on actual combat endeavors.  It also allowed advancements to be uniform between the branches.  When the branches had compartmentalized research and development, if the Army developed a brand new, state-of-the-art bullet, it probably wouldn't be compatible with the weapons developed by the Navy.  ARPA also fixed that issue.  The first major project for ARPA, was the quest to resolve the telephone's fatal flaw inherit in the circuit-switching centers.
