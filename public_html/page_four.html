    <h1>Separation of Concerns</h1>
    <article id="primaryContent">
        <hr>
        <h2>Why Should we Separate our Concerns?</h2>
        <p>
            The idea that is known as Separation of Concerns is a key principle of software development. The general idea behind it is that when programming you want to keep one area of your application focused on only one process. Each process (or in other words each area of concern) should be compartmentalized within your code. Separation of Concerns can often happen as a direct consequence of trying to keep your code concise and not repeat yourself. Unlike most consequences though, this is a good one to have.
        </p>
        <p>
            Separation of Concerns is good practice for a few reasons. For one, it makes troubleshooting issues a lot easier. Say you are testing a function of yours that does five different things to an input and then produces a result. If during the testing you realize it is not producing the result you're expecting it to, it's going to be much more difficult to diagnose where the problem is occurring than if the function only performed one action on the input.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a similar vein, another benefit of Separation of Concerns comes when you figure out a way to update or improve the code within your existing methods or functions. Back to the previous example, if one of your functions is doing five things, and you try to streamline one of those five by altering the code, there's a good chance you can break the whole function. The rest of the code was relying on the part you are changing, and this can often have unforeseen consequences. This can be easily avoided if we have proper Separation of Concerns.
        </p>
        <h2>Examples from our Calculator</h2>
        <h3>Isolated Arithmetic Processes</h3>
        <p>
            Our calculator is very neatly employing the principle of Separation of Concerns. We have programmed all of our classes to be so modular, that they each have a specific thing they deal with and that is all. One major example is the splitting up of our four arithmetic classes: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division. Take a look at our Division and Multiplication classes below.
        </p>
        <p>
            <code style="display:block; white-space:pre-wrap">
    from calc.calculations.calculation import Calculation

    class Division(Calculation):
        """Class for the Division calculation"""

        def get_result(self):
            """This does the actual division. Displays an error if dividing by 0"""
            quotient = self.values[0]
            for value in self.values[1:]:
                if value == 0.0:
                    return "Error, cannot divide by zero."
                quotient = quotient / value
            return quotient

    class Multiplication(Calculation):
        """Class for the Multiplication calculation"""

        def get_result(self):
            """This does the actual multiplication."""
            product = 1.0
            for value in self.values:
                product = product * value
            return product
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>
            We have separated the division and multiplication processes for our Calculator into two different classes. The Addition and Subtraction processes are similarly split into their own classes as well. This way if our Calculator is ever encountering problems with one of the arithmetic processes, we know where to look to try and resolve it. If each arithmetic process were contained within one class, or contained within one method using logical <code>if/elif/else</code> statements to determine which arithmetic process to execute, diagnosing and fixing problems would prove much more difficult.
        </p>
        <h3>Who's Keeping Track of History?</h3>
        <p>
            There is one other very clear example of Separation of Concerns that our Calculator uses. Our Calculator utilizes a history attribute in order to keep track of what calculations we have done. That being said, take a look at the actual Calculator class:
        </p>
        <p>
            <code style="display:block; white-space:pre-wrap">
    """This class performs the basic calculator functions"""

    from calc.history.calculations import Calculations

    class Calculator:
        """This is my Calculator class"""

        @staticmethod
        def add_numbers(tuple_values: tuple):
            """Adds a tuple of numbers together"""
            Calculations.add_addition_calculation(tuple_values)
            return True

        @staticmethod
        def subtract_numbers(tuple_values: tuple):
            """Subtracts a tuple of numbers from the first value"""
            Calculations.add_subtraction_calculation(tuple_values)
            return True

        @staticmethod
        def multiply_numbers(tuple_values: tuple):
            """Multiplies a tuple of numbers together"""
            Calculations.add_multiplication_calculation(tuple_values)
            return True

        @staticmethod
        def divide_numbers(tuple_values: tuple):
            """Divides number in tuple by the next, returns error if any # after the first is 0"""
            Calculations.add_division_calculation(tuple_values)
            return True

        @staticmethod
        def get_last_result_value():
            """This will get the result of the last calculation"""
            return Calculations.get_last_calculation_result()
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite us using a history to keep track of all our calculations, that history is not actually contained within the Calculator class. Our Calculator class is focused solely on calling which arithmetic calculation the user wishes to call. That is its concern. Managing the history of our Calculator is a separate concern. That is why we have the Calculations class. The concern for our Calculations class is managing and interacting with the history. Whether that be adding to it, clearing it, displaying an individual result from it, or displaying how many items are within it. This concern falls squarely on the shoulders of the Calculations class, as you can see by looking at it below. Our Calculations class is very large, so I included part of it here as it still conveys the point I am making.
        </p>
        <p>
            <code style="display:block; white-space:pre-wrap">
    """Calculation history class"""

    from calc.calculations.addition import Addition
    from calc.calculations.subtraction import Subtraction
    from calc.calculations.multiplication import Multiplication
    from calc.calculations.division import Division

    class Calculations:
        """This class works with the history of the calculator"""

        history = []

        @staticmethod
        def clear_history():
            """Clears all values in history"""
            Calculations.history.clear()
            return True

        @staticmethod
        def count_history():
            """Returns the number of items in the history"""
            return len(Calculations.history)

        @staticmethod
        def get_first_calculation_object():
            """Returns first calculation in history"""
            return Calculations.history[0]

        @staticmethod
        def get_first_calculation_result():
            """Returns value of first calculation in history"""
            calculation = Calculations.get_first_calculation_object()
            return calculation.get_result()

        @staticmethod
        def add_calculation(calculation):
            """Adds a specific calculation to history"""
            return Calculations.history.append(calculation)

        @staticmethod
        def add_addition_calculation(values):
            """Creates an addition object and adds it to history using factory method create"""
            Calculations.add_calculation(Addition.create(values))
            return True

        @staticmethod
        def add_subtraction_calculation(values):
            """Creates a subtraction object and adds it to history using factory method create"""
            Calculations.add_calculation(Subtraction.create(values))
            return True

    ...
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>
            A couple more methods exist within the Calculations class, but they are all very similar to the ones above and also work directly with the history attribute in some way. As you can see we are following the best practices of programming and maintaining a Separation of Concerns for our Calculator program.
