    <h1>Separation of Concerns</h1>
    <article id="primaryContent">
        <hr>
        <h2>Why Should we Separate our Concerns?</h2>
        <p>
            The idea that is known as Separation of Concerns is a key principle of software development. The general idea behind it is that when programming you want to keep one area of your application focused on only one process. Each process (or in other words each area of concern) should be compartmentalized within your code. Separation of Concerns can often happen as a direct consequence of trying to keep your code concise and not repeat yourself. Unlike most consequences though, this is a good one to have.
        </p>
        <p>
            Separation of Concerns is good practice for a few reasons. For one, it makes troubleshooting issues a lot easier. Say you are testing a function of yours that does five different things to an input and then produces a result. If during the testing you realize it is not producing the result you're expecting it to, it's going to be much more difficult to diagnose where the problem is occurring than if the function only performed one action on the input.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a similar vein, another benefit of Separation of Concerns comes when you figure out a way to update or improve the code within your existing methods or functions. Back to the previous example, if one of your functions is doing five things, and you try to streamline one of those five by altering the code, there's a good chance you can break the whole function. The rest of the code was relying on the part you are changing, and this can often have unforeseen consequences. This can be easily avoided if we have proper Separation of Concerns.
        </p>
        <h2>Examples from our Calculator</h2>
        <p>
            Our calculator is very neatly employing the principle of Separation of Concerns. We have programmed all of our classes to be so modular, that they each have a specific thing they deal with and that is all. One major example is the splitting up of our four arithmetic classes: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division. Take a look at our Division and Multiplication classes below.
        </p>
        <p>
            <code style="display:block; white-space:pre-wrap">
    from calc.calculations.calculation import Calculation

    class Division(Calculation):
        """Class for the Division calculation"""

        def get_result(self):
            """This does the actual division. Displays an error if dividing by 0"""
            quotient = self.values[0]
            for value in self.values[1:]:
                if value == 0.0:
                    return "Error, cannot divide by zero."
                quotient = quotient / value
            return quotient

    class Multiplication(Calculation):
        """Class for the Multiplication calculation"""

        def get_result(self):
            """This does the actual multiplication."""
            product = 1.0
            for value in self.values:
                product = product * value
            return product
            </code>
