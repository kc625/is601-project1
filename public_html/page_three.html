        <h2>Seeking Convenience, Finding Innovation</h2>
        <p>
            Robert Taylor (who often went by Bob) worked for ARPA in the 1960s under J.C Licklider.  There were several computers that they used at the time.  Each of these computers required its own terminal in order to use it.  This bothered Bob Taylor.  He was annoyed by the fact that every time he wanted to switch the computer he was using, he had to switch which terminal he was using as well.  He theorized that if there was a way to have the computers connected somehow, then he could use just one terminal in order to access all of them.  It was decided that in order to form the network, they would use four identical, mini-computers.  These mini-computers would all be connected with one another and accessible via one terminal.  Each mini-computer would then also be connected directly to its own main computer, which would allow the main computer access to the network.  This is the first computer network in history to be created.  This network eventually become known as the ARPANET.  The ARPANET was the precursor to the internet as we know it today.

        <h2>If You Build it, They will Come</h2>
        <p>
            In 1969, the company BBN (Bolt Beranek & Newman) was contracted to build the mini-computers ARPA needed.  They became known as IMPs, with IMP standing for Interface Message Processor.  These IMPs were capable of implementing the packet-switching process needed to create a connected network.  BBN was able to build the IMPs and the ARPANET was successfully up and running.  So long as there was an IMP to connect to their main computer, it didn't matter where they were physically located, they would be able to connect into the ARPANET.  By 1971, several computers had been connected, all on the west coast.  Then Robert Metcalfe, a graduate student at MIT at the time, connected a computer to the ARPANET located at MIT.  This was the first computer to be connected not physically located in the west coast, and it showed that the network could still function at incredibly long distances.  By 1972, there was just fewer than 25 computers connected to the ARPANET, but they were located all around the United States and more were in the process of being added.  This was a huge jump from the original 4 computers that formed the network, all on the west coast.  Most of these computers were located either at military bases or university campuses.  They were initially used as a communication network for ARPA.

        <h2>An Interconnected Country</h2>
        <p>
            Initially, there wasn't much to do on the ARPANET.  The first important application created was email.  Raymond Tomlinson was the coder and inventor of this first email system, in which he completed all the work for it during his own free time.  He was also the one who made the choice to use the @ sign to designate where to send the email.  His reasoning behind the choice was that the mail was being sent to someone that was "at" a certain computer.  He felt it was a natural fit, and it has become an iconic symbol today.  Developing what computers were capable of was a collaborative effort.  Anyone that was connected to the ARPANET was encouraged to share what information they were working on, opening it up to critiques and assistance from others.  This open collaboration helped speed up the development of the internet and computers in general.  This freedom of information-sharing was the cornerstone of what internet culture was built on, and to this day it still largely functions the same way.

        <h2>Time to Show Off</h2>
        <p>
            After all of the success that ARPA was having on their ARPANET project, they decided it was time to display how far they had come.  To do so ARPA sponsored an event, the International Conference on Computer Communications (ICCC).  It was held in October 1972 and was one of the first public demonstrations of computer networking technology and functionality.  Leading up to the ICCC, Robert Metcalfe was tasked with compiling a list of everything the ARPANET network was capable of in order to showcase this at the conference.  He spoke with everyone that had a computer connected to the ARPANET, and eventually had a list of 19 things that were able to be done on a computer connected to the network.  Some examples of these programs were email, games that could be played, interacting with an air traffic control system, and showing off symbolic representations of mathematical formulas.  The ARPANET demo was an incredible success, and it vastly accelerated the use and expansion of the ARPANET.  As more users connected, it was slowly becoming clsoer to the internet as we know it today.
